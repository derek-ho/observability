# Security Domain Schema

OpenSearch Security is a [plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security) for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication and authorization. When combined with OpenSearch Security-Advanced Modules, it supports authentication via Active Directory, LDAP, Kerberos, JSON web tokens, SAML, OpenID and more. It includes fine grained role-based access control to indices, documents and fields. It also provides multi-tenancy support in OpenSearch Dashboards.

Another leading security specification if the [Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema)
OCSF is a framework for creating schemas and it also delivers a cybersecurity event schema built with the framework.

OCSF framework is made up of a set of categories, event classes, data types, and an attribute dictionary. The framework is not restricted to cybersecurity nor to events, however the initial focus of the framework has been a schema for cybersecurity events. A schema browser for the cybersecurity schema can be found at schema.ocsf.io. This is the recommended way to explore the schema.
